                                                                   Mentality
Getting my feet wet when it comes to coding. I'm someone who has a passion for gaming, but also found how intriguing coding is. However, as everytime I have time to practice I learn something new everytime. First of all let me breackdown the mental of this project before I tell you what I learn while doing this. When people say coding isn't for everyone they aren't lying to you if you're not patient and open minded to making mistakes. It comes with being patient and making a lot of mistakes. A lot of codes and techniques will not work, and one letter out of place and your entire web page is messed up. The ticket attempting and failing. We must come at projects or coding with an open mind and being ok with making mistakes. as much as its frustrating when codes don't work, its rewarding when find out dealing with coding with the vibe that youre going to achieve it.

There was nothing wrong with the how the live webpage looked, however it was the how the skeleton looked is where the issue lies. My instincts as writer tells me there are a lot of non-senametic div tags, in the new age of coding there is an alternative way to divide a web page in section. I replaced majority of the div tags with senametic tags like <nav>,<article>, <aside>,<figure> and <footer>. There is only one div tag in the skeleton for the navigation bar, so I'm guessing that's the necessary div tag because without it the content on navigation bar is out of place. To go back to writing one of my mentors told me to never repeat a word when starting a new line and the first think that pop out were the excessive div tags websites html. There were excessive div tags, but I have better understanding of when and not to use them.
